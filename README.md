# Genetic Algorithm for Finding Methuselahs in Conway's Game of Life

This project implements a genetic algorithm designed to evolve configurations in Conway's Game of Life to optimize for long lifespans, maximum alive cells, and growth ratios. The primary goal is to discover "Methuselahs" â€” patterns that live for many generations before stabilizing or repeating.

## Overview

The system consists of:
1. A genetic algorithm that evolves configurations based on fitness scores.
2. A simulation of Conway's Game of Life to evaluate configurations.
3. An interactive visualization tool for exploring results.

The genetic algorithm evaluates configurations for:
- **Lifespan**: The number of unique generations before stabilization or repetition.
- **Maximum Alive Cells**: The maximum number of living cells in any generation.
- **Growth Ratio**: The ratio between the maximum and minimum number of living cells.
- **Stableness**: The frequency of reaching static or periodic behavior.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Mutation Rate**: Adjusted based on the fitness trends.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Navigate through generations and configurations.
- **Fitness Optimization**: Multi-objective scoring system to balance lifespan, growth, and stability.
